            You got yourself a cool new inflatable boat and are ready to sail
            into the Berlin sunset. <span class="emoji">&#9973 </span><br>
            But like a true Berliner you decided to first make the Spree look a
            little better.
            <br>
            Collect as much debris as possible and make sure you don't upset the birds. <span class ="emoji">&#129414; 	&#129442;</span>

            <p><strong>Pollution Impact </strong> <br>
                Urban areas generate a large amount of plastic waste, and much of it ends up in rivers. <br> Single-use plastics like bottles, bags, and packaging are commonly discarded irresponsibly, finding their way into waterways. <br> The presence of plastic debris in rivers not only harms aquatic species but can also contribute to the breakdown of plastic into microplastics, which have widespread ecological impacts.</p>
